## Introduction

Hello, welcome to an Analysis of my reading journey. A little bit of background: I started reading again in 2018, after 6-7 years of not touching any book. The last book I had read before was when I was in 8th grade :D. 

Since I started reading in 2018, I've been keeping track of the books I read, rating and reviews on Goodreads, and after two years, I had this small set of data available. I came across when Goodreads showed me some stats on their website. 

Moreover, I recently started learning data science on my own, therefore I am so thrilled to analyze this data. My purpose of this analysis is to answer some simple exploratory and descriptive analysis questions:  
1. How much books I've read over the years ? Do I read more every year?  
2. I read books in Vietnamese and English? How many of those are Viet and how many are English?  
3. Are there correlation between time of year and the amount of reading ?  
4. Do I give better rating than other people do ?  
5. How fast do I read ?  

## Datasets and Methodology
The dataset is stored in a .csv file. It has data of all the books I have read, such as their title, author, date published, date I started reading, date I finished, etc.
There are 57 books in this dataset.   
After exporting it from Goodreads, I used R Studio and R Markdown to analyze, create charts, and write up the report.   
Check the full report in the link on the top.  

## Conclusion
Answers to question above:
1. I read 51 books so far. And I do read more every year.
2. Half of the books I read are Vietnamese.
3. There are not a lot of correlation between time of year and amount of reading.
4. Books I found ‘meh’ got higher rating from other people, and books I loved got lower rating.
5. I read around 30 pages/day.

Even though this analysis is mostly exploratory in essence, I found that it is a great exercise as a beginner. I also think there are a lot more to be done in the future.
From this project, I learned that I need to put more time into exploring the data, before doing any type of analysis. I spent a lot of time making graphs and charts, because of not knowing syntax and not understanding data structures. The write-ups were quite short for the time I put into each graphs.  

I could also learn more by reading other analyses on Goodreads data.  
This is one of my first projects I did on something I like. And I was surprised with the amount of time I put in it. It felt great. I’m gonna do this at the end of 2021 as well.
